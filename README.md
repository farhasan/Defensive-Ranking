#Defensive Ranking

This is a project which mostly gathers NBA statistics of players, the point being to utilitze them in different ways. For this project specifically, I want to develop two formulas to use to ranking the type of defender an NBA player is (meaning how effective they are, how "good" they are.) At the time of this description being written, the formulas are still being figured out but the point in having more than one formula is because it makes more sense to have distinct formulas for perimeter players and interior players being that you look for different things when gauging perimeter defense and interior defense.
